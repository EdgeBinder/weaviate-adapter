A Weaviate adapter for EdgeBinder that leverages Weaviate's vector database capabilities to store and query entity relationships with rich metadata and semantic similarity features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Strategy: Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Adapter (Current Implementation)
**Status: Ready to Implement**
- Uses current Zestic Weaviate PHP client capabilities
- Implements core `PersistenceAdapterInterface` methods
- Provides basic relationship storage and retrieval
- Supports rich metadata without vector features

### Phase 2: Vector Enhancement (Future)
**Status: Requires Client Enhancement**
- Contribute vector query support to Zestic client
- Add semantic similarity search capabilities
- Implement advanced GraphQL query features
- Enable AI/ML relationship discovery

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Composer
- Weaviate 1.31+ (for integration testing)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)

## Installation

```bash
composer require edgebinder/weaviate-adapter
```

## Quick Start

```php
<?php

use EdgeBinder\EdgeBinder;
use EdgeBinder\Adapter\Weaviate\WeaviateAdapter;
use Weaviate\WeaviateClient;

// Connect to Weaviate
$weaviateClient = WeaviateClient::connectToLocal();

// Create the adapter
$adapter = new WeaviateAdapter($weaviateClient, [
    'collection_name' => 'MyAppBindings',
    'schema' => [
        'auto_create' => true,
        'vectorizer' => 'text2vec-openai'
    ]
]);

// Create EdgeBinder instance
$binder = new EdgeBinder($adapter);

// Use EdgeBinder as normal
$workspace = new Entity('workspace-123', 'Workspace');
$project = new Entity('project-456', 'Project');

$binding = $binder->bind(
    from: $workspace,
    to: $project,
    type: 'has_access',
    metadata: [
        'access_level' => 'write',
        'granted_by' => 'user-789',
        'confidence_score' => 0.95
    ]
);
```

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/edgebinder/weaviate-adapter.git
cd weaviate-adapter

# Install dependencies
composer install
```

### Running Tests

#### Unit Tests (No External Dependencies)
```bash
# Run unit tests only
composer test-unit
```

#### Integration Tests (Requires Weaviate)
```bash
# Using Docker (Recommended)
composer test-docker

# Using external Weaviate instance
export WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080
composer test-integration
```

#### All Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with Docker
composer test-docker

# Run all tests with external Weaviate
composer test
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run PHPStan static analysis
composer phpstan

# Check coding standards
composer cs-check

# Fix coding standards
composer cs-fix

# Run all linting
composer lint
```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Start Weaviate for development
composer docker-start

# Stop Weaviate
composer docker-stop

# Reset Weaviate data
composer docker-reset
```

## Features

### Phase 1 (Current)
- âœ… Core CRUD operations
- âœ… Rich metadata storage
- âœ… Entity-based queries
- âœ… Multi-tenancy support
- âœ… Automatic schema management

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- ðŸŽ¯ Vector similarity search
- ðŸŽ¯ Semantic concept queries
- ðŸŽ¯ Advanced GraphQL queries
- ðŸŽ¯ Batch vector operations
- ðŸŽ¯ AI/ML integration features
